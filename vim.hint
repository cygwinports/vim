ldesc: "Vim (Vi IMproved) is an almost compatible version of the UNIX 
editor vi. Almost every possible command can be performed using only 
ASCII characters. Many new features have been added: multilevel undo, 
command line history, file name completion, block operations, and 
editing of binary data."
